# Classifying Quantum Phases of Matter

This repository contains my solution to the **FLIQ Science Track Challenge**:  
**"Classifying Quantum Phases of Matter using Quantum Machine Learning (QML)"**.

The task is to classify distinct quantum phases (Z₂ and Z₃) using **classical shadows** (compressed measurements of quantum states). The classifier is implemented using a hybrid **physics-informed + quantum circuit** approach to maximize accuracy while minimizing computational cost.

## Challenge Summary

> **Objective:**  
Build a quantum machine learning model that takes **reduced density matrices** (extracted from classical shadows) as input and classifies the **quantum phase** of the system.

> **Evaluation Function:**  
The scoring metric is a function of:
```

f(A, P, D, W) = αA − βP − γD − δW

```
Where:
- **A**: Accuracy (maximize)
- **P**: Parameters (minimize)
- **D**: Circuit depth (minimize)
- **W**: Qubit width (minimize)

## Approach

### Feature Engineering

- **Physics-Informed Feature Extraction**: 25 domain-specific features were engineered using knowledge of quantum observables (e.g., magnetization, density wave, blockade violations).
- **Feature Selection**: Top 8 features selected via F-score ranking and cross-validation.

### Quantum Classifier Architecture

- **Qubits**: 2
- **Circuit Depth**: 6 (2 layers × 3 gates)
- **Trainable Parameters**: 4
- **Quantum Layers**: Alternating RX, RY, and entangling CZ gates
- **Readout**: Expectation of Pauli-Z operators for phase classification
